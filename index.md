#### Public Health, Data Science, Biostatistics

I am an assistant scientist  
where I work with 
[Dr. Jennifer Schrack](https://twitter.com/jenschrack?lang=en) 
and the 
[ENGAGE](https://engageresearchlab.org) 
group on development of methods for analyzing data from wearable sensors in aging populations.

I recently completed my postdoctoral fellowship with the 
[Epidemiology and Biostatistics of Aging Training Program](https://coah.jhu.edu/graduate-programs-and-postdoctoral-training/epidemiology-and-biostatistics-of-aging/),
and I received my PhD in Biostatistics from the 
[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu)
, under the guidance of Ciprian Crainiceanu and the WIT research group. 

As an undergraduate at 
[St. Olaf College](https://wp.stolaf.edu/mscs/)
, I studied Math, Statistics, and Environmental Studies. 
I was a fellow in the 
[Center for Interdisciplinary Research](https://wp.stolaf.edu/cir/)
, I assisted with research at the Cannon River Watershed Partnership (now called 
[Clean River Partners](https://cleanriverpartners.org)
), and I was a junior fellow at the 
[Joint Program in Survey Methodology](https://jpsm.umd.edu/academics/junior-fellows-program) 
when I assisted with questionnaire design at the 
[National Agrigultural Statistics Service](https://www.nass.usda.gov/index.php).


## Public Health (Under Construction)

During my Ph.D., I collaborated with clinicians in the 
[Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study](https://aidscohortstudy.org) 
to better understand differences in physical activity and 
[heart health](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31707799/) 
between men living with and without HIV.

## Data Science (Under Construction)

I work on posture classification with chest-worn accelerometers, often embedded in ECG patches, as a means to contextualize cardiac activity. 

Check out some interactive plots I made here [here](https://etzkorn.github.io/Images/Interactive_Plots/FullSphere_ChangePoint.html).

I am currently working on an R package with a vignette which I will link here in the coming months,
but for now I will just leave you with an interactive `plotly` graphic that shows the kind of data stucture we use for classifying posture.

## Biostatistics (Under Construction)

As an undergraduate at Saint Olaf College, I got to be a part of an innovative course designed by 
[Paul Roback and Julie Legler](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/).

For three years during graduate school, I worked with Elizabeth Colantuoni and Scott Zeger as TA for the JHSPH combined series of Longitudinal Data Analysis and Multilevel Models. 
As a part of my dissertation research, I am working with Dr. Colantuoni on developing new functions within [`frailtypack`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/frailtypack/index.html) 
for the joint modelling of multiple recurrent event and survival outcomes.
We think these kinds of models will be important for clinical trials conducted within Intensive Care Units (ICUs).
