# Public Health, Data Science, Biostatistics

I am a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu) and expect to defend my dissertation in December 2021 or January 2022.

As an undergraduate at [St. Olaf College](https://wp.stolaf.edu/mscs/), I studied Math, Statistics, and Environmental Studies.

## Biostatistics

I was introduced to the world of correlated data very early on. 
As an undergraduate at Saint Olaf College, I got to be a part of an innovative course designed by [Paul Roback and Julie Legler] (https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/).

For three years during graduate school, I worked with Elizabeth Colantuoni and Scott Zeger as TA for the JHSPH combined series of Longitudinal Data Analysis and Multilevel Models. 
As a part of my dissertation research, I am working with Dr. Colantuoni on developing new functions within [`frailtypack`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/frailtypack/index.html) for the joint modelling of multiple recurrent event and survival outcomes.
We think these kinds of models will be important for clinical trials conducted within Intensive Care Units (ICUs).
